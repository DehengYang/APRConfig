In RQ1 of our work, we identified 17 APR evaluation biases via an SLR (i.e., systematic literature review) and we are curious about if these exposed biases have been mitigated in the subsequent APR evaluations. Therefore, we collected a total of 36 APR-evaluation related papers published in the last two years (i.e., from 2020 to 2021) and manually check if they have mitigated the 17 biases. In particular, we further contact authors of the investigated publications for their confirmation on our check results. 

## 1. Acknowledgement
We are truly thankful for the huge support of all authors of the investigated publications. Even when they were busy, many of them kindly provided great help by agreeing with our check results or pointing out our potential misunderstandings. Furthermore, some authors contributed a set of constructive and insightful suggestions that could make our work more solid. After the confirmation process, we rectified our misunderstandings and improved our check results. We believe the updated check results are more convincing than the previous version.

We sincerely appreciate the great contributions they have made to the APR community via these excellent publications, and we greatly appreciate their great kindness, patience, and generosity during the communication.

## 2. Interesting and Insightful Comments during the confirmation Process

We received many positive comments and insightful suggestions, which greatly inspires us to polish our work and present a better version to the APR community.

Some comments: 

+ *Thank you for providing further clarification. We find this type of research very valuable for the community. Thank you for investigating this! Looking forward to reading the paper.*
+ *This is very exciting work you are doing, and I look forward to reading the final version!*
+ *I added a couple notes to your observations, but I think your summary of our paper is fair.* 
+ *I have checked the form, and agreed with your manual checking results.*
+ *Thank you for reaching out. I think you are investigating a very interesting problem.*

Some suggestions:
+ *Thank you for sending us your manual check for checking. I think, you should definitely consider adding "Not Applicable" to your options. A "No" might seem as if the bias exists but was not mitigated.* (P.S. We have adopted this suggestion.)
+ Some authors of the investigated papers suggested that it may be unfair to judge whether a paper mitigates the bias exposed at the same time period or after its publication date. Therefore, for fairness, we exclude the biases exposed at the same time or after the publication of the investigated paper. Accordingly, we added "Not Considered" to our options.

We thank again for the kind words and great help of the authors of investigated publications.
